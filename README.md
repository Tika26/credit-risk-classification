# credit-risk-classification

## Resource: lending_data.csv
## Purpose: 
 *Used this csv file, trying to predict the loaners loan status which will help to predict about their future loans.
 * created logical regression model to do prediction for credit -risk- classification.

##Results:
* Healthy loan ("0") prediction value is
     precision = 1.00
     recall = 0.99
     f1-score = 1.00
     
* High risk loan ("1") prediction value is
             precision = 0.84
             recall = 0.94
             f1-score = 0.89
             
## Summary:
Here the supervised machine learning model is used for predicction which gave almost 99% accuracy in the result. so, i advocte machine learning to do prediction with this model which will help to achive 100% result , to make company to succed.
